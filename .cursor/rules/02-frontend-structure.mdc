The frontend is organized as a responsive, single-page dashboard that displays BYD car sales data.

## Key Files

- [js/main.js](mdc:js/main.js): JavaScript functionality for the dashboard

## Main Sections

The dashboard has several key sections:

1. **Hero Section**: Introductory section with title and period selector
2. **Dashboard Section**: Summary KPIs and main charts
3. **Detail Section**: Detailed data table with filtering options
4. **Compare Section**: Tool for comparing different car models

## Charts and Visualizations

The dashboard uses ECharts for data visualization:

- Bar chart for top car models by sales

## Data Flow

1. Data is loaded from the backend when the page initializes
